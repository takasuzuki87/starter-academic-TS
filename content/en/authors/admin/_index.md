I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Texas at Austin, School of Information. Broadly, I am interested in how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) affects people's behavioral and psychological experiences in cities. In particular, I explore how ICT mediates social interaction and shapes people’s attachment toward cities.
Prior to starting the Ph.D. program, I had 8 years of work experience as a data analyst and project manager in both public and private sectors.
